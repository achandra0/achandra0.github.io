<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<h4>This is probably the first website I am building, and I am loving it!</h4>
<p>My name is Ananya Chandra. I hail from New Delhi, India. I am currently enrolled at University of Nebraska at Omaha for a Masters in Management Information Systems. In my home country I was working with Aon Hewitt as a Business Analyst. Watching cute dog videos on youtube is probably my favorite way to pass time. Other than that, I also love to eat and cook and capture the surroundings.</p>
<p>Feel free to navigate through the site to get to know me.</p>

<p>Here are some of my own photos. It will help you spot me ;)</p>
